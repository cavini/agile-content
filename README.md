Hi! Welcome to my submission for the front end developer position.

To be completely honest, I didn't have much time to work on this project. I think in total I spent around 8 hours working on this.
That's why I did everything in one branch. I was going to start off by creating a main branch with basic config, and open up PR's as I would code along, but honestly I never had the time to do so.
So I decided to focus on funcionality, rather than semantics.

To guarantee that my code is production ready, here is the application running on netlify: https://develop--bright-rabanadas-1f1f48.netlify.app/

The application overall is very simple. If you go to any route other than /search, you will be prompted with the home screen.
If you try to access the /search page without searching anything you will see a message asking you to search something.
You can resize the window to see the design changes for different devices.

This application uses:
* React,
* TypeScript,
* OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
* JavaScript Classes
* Jest and React Test Library for unit testing
* Styled Components
* Vite bundler (a faster alterantive to CRA)
* Custom hooks
* Error handling
* Reusable components
* Prop handling and validation
* Prop mapping


To run this application:

Simply go to the root of the project, using your terminal, and run npm i && npm run dev
(make sure you have Node and npm installed)
