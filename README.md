Hi! Welcome to my submission for the front end developer position.

To be completely honest, I didn't have much time to work on this project. I think in total I spent around 8 hours working on this.
That's why I did everything in one branch. I was going to start off by creating a main branch with basic config, and open up PR's as I would code along, but honestly I never had the time to do so.
So I decided to focus on funcionality, rather than semantics.
